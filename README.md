> PARL is a flexible and high-efficient reinforcement learning framework based on [PaddlePaddle](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle).

# Features
**Reproducible**. We provide algorithms that stably reproduce the result of many influential reinforcement learning algorithms

**Large Scale**. Ability to support high performance parallelization of training with thousands of CPUs and multi-GPUs 

**Reusable**.  Algorithms provided in repository could be directly adapted to a new task by defining a forward network and training mechanism will be built automatically.

**Extensible**. Build new algorithms quickly by inheriting the abstract class in the framework.


# Abstractions
<img src=".github/abstractions.png" alt="abstractions" width="400"/>  
PARL aims to build an agent for training algorithms to perform complex tasks.   
The main abstractions introduced by PARL that are used to build an agent recursively are the following:

### Model
`Model` is abstracted to construct the forward network which defines a policy network or critic network given state as input.

### Algorithm
`Algorithm` describes the mechanism to update parameters in `Model` and often contains at least one model.

### Agent
`Agent` is a data bridge between environment and algorithm. It is responsible for data I/O with outside and describes data preprocessing before feeding data into the training process.

Here is an example of building an agent with DQN algorithm for atari games.
```python
import parl
from parl.algorithms import DQN, DDQN

class AtariModel(parl.Model):
	"""AtariModel
	This class defines the forward part for an algorithm,
	its input is state observed on environment.
	"""
	def __init__(self, img_shape, action_dim):
		# define your layers
		self.cnn1 = layers.conv_2d(num_filters=32, filter_size=5,
			 			stride=1, padding=2, act='relu')
		...
		self.fc1 = layers.fc(action_dim)
	def value(self, img):
		# define how to estimate the Q value based on the image of atari games.
		img = img / 255.0
		l = self.cnn1(img)
		...
		Q = self.fc1(l)
		return Q
"""
three steps to build an agent
   1.  define a forward model which is critic_model in this example
   2.  a. to build a DQN algorithm, just pass the critic_model to `DQN`
       b. to build a DDQN algorithm, just replace DQN in following line with DDQN
   3.  define the I/O part in AtariAgent so that it could update the algorithm based on the interactive data
"""

model = AtariModel(img_shape=(32, 32), action_dim=4)
algorithm = DQN(model)
agent = AtariAgent(algorithm)
