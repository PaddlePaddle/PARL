## Reproduce CQL with PARL

Based on PARL, the CQL algorithm of deep reinforcement learning has been reproduced, reaching the same level of indicators as the paper on continuous control datasets from the D4RL benchmark.

> Paper: CQL in [Conservative Q-Learning for Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04779)

### Env and dataset introduction
+ D4RL datasets: This algorithm is tested in the D4RL dataset, one of the most commonly used dataset for offline RL. For more details about D4RL, please see [here](https://sites.google.com/view/d4rl/home). D4RL require Mujoco as a dependency. For more D4RL usage methods, please refer to its [guide](https://github.com/rail-berkeley/d4rl#using-d4rl).
+ Mujoco simulator: Please see [here](http://mujoco.org/) to know more about Mujoco simulator and obtain a license.

### Benchmark result
