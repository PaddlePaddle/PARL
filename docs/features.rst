Features
===========

**1. Reproducible**

| We provide algorithms that reproduce stably the results of many influential reinforcement learning algorithms.

**2. Large Scale**

| Ability to support high-performance parallelization of training with thousands of CPUs and multi-GPUs.

**3. Reusable**

| Algorithms provided in the repository can be directly adapted to new tasks by defining a forward network and training mechanism will be built automatically.

**4. Extensible**

| Build new algorithms quickly by inheriting the abstract class in the framework.
