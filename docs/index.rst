Abstractions

| PARL aims to build an **agent** for training algorithms to perform complex tasks.   
| The main abstractions introduced by PARL that are used to build an agent recursively are the following:

* **Model** is abstracted to construct the forward network which defines a policy network or critic network given state as input.

* **Algorithm** describes the mechanism to update parameters in the *model* and often contains at least one model.

* **Agent**, a data bridge between the *environment* and the *algorithm*, is responsible for data I/O with the outside environment and describes data preprocessing before feeding data into the training process.
