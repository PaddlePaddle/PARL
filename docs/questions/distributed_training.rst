Recommended data types in xparl
###############################
Python is an interpreted language, which means the source code of a Python program is converted into bytecode that is then executed by the Python virtual machine. On the other hand, xparl lacks prior knowledge of the data to be transmitted to a remote class instance, making it inadequate to convert the user-defined data into a binary data stream. Therefore, it is advisable for users to utilize native Python data types such as Int, Dict, and Numpy Array when passing arguments to or retrieving results from a remote class instance.
