Recommended data types in xparl
###############################
Python is an interpreted language, unlike C++ that compile the codes before running. Thus xparl lacks prior knowledge of the data to be transmitted to a remote class instance, making it inadequate to convert the user-defined data into a binary data stream. Therefore, it is advisable for users to utilize native Python data types such as Int, Dict, and Numpy Array when passing arguments to or retrieving results from a remote class instance.
