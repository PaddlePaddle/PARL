## Reproduce ES with PARL
Based on PARL, we have implemented the Evolution Strategies (ES) algorithm and evaluate it in Mujoco environments. Its performance reaches the same level of indicators as the paper.

## How to use
### Dependencies
+ [paddlepaddle>=1.6.1](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle)
+ [parl](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PARL)
+ gym==0.9.4
+ mujoco-py==0.5.1


### Distributed Training

To replicate the performance reported above, we encourage you to train with 96 CPUs.  
If you haven't created a cluster before, enter the following command to create a cluster. For more information about the cluster, please refer to our [documentation](https://parl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/parallel_training/setup.html).

```bash
xparl start --port 8037 --cpu_num 96
```

Then we can start the distributed training by running:


```bash
python train.py
```

Training result will be saved in `train_log` with training curve that can be visualized in tensorboard data.
