class Master(object):
    """Base class for a master node, the control center for our cluster, which provides connections to workers and clients.

    There is only one master node in each cluster, and it is responsible for
    receiving jobs from the clients and allocating computation resources to
    run the jobs.

    To start a master node, we use the following xparl command line api:

    .. code-block:: python

        xparl start --port localhost:1234

    At the same time, a local worker will be started and connect to the
    master node.

    Attributes:
        job_center (JobCenter): A thread-safe data structure that stores the job address of vacant cpus.
        client_socket (zmq.Context.socket): A socket that receives submitted
                                           job from the client, and later sends
                                           job_address back to the client.
        cpu_num(int): The number of available CPUs in the cluster.
        worker_num(int): The number of workers connected to this cluster.

    Args:
        port: The ip port that the master node binds to.
